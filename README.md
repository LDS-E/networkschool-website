# networkschool-website

This project is a website developed from a **PSD** file (mockup) and aims to provide a **solid structure** for a responsive website, following **best development practices**.

## 📌 Project Objective

The main objective of this project was to create a functional website with a focus on:

- **Semantic HTML structuring** to ensure accessibility and proper content organization.
- **Responsive CSS styling** to provide a good user experience on different devices.
- **Faithful conversion of a PSD to a web layout**, maintaining the design provided in the mockup.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** → Structuring the page with a focus on semantics.
- **CSS3** → Styling the website, including layout and responsiveness.
- **Adobe Photoshop** → Used for the initial design (PSD mockup).

## 🎨 Development Process

### ✅ PSD to HTML and CSS Conversion

The development started with the **PSD mockup**, which served as a reference for structuring the website in **HTML and CSS**. The focus was on:

- Creating a **semantic** and **accessible** HTML structure.
- Implementing a **clean, maintainable, and responsive** CSS layout.
- Ensuring **pixel-perfect** conversion from the mockup.

### ✅ Semantic HTML

The website structure follows the best practices for **semantic HTML**, ensuring better accessibility and SEO. Key elements used:

- **Structural Tags** → `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`.
- **Accessible Elements** → Proper usage of `alt` attributes for images.
- **HTML Validation** → Checked using the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

### ✅ CSS Styling

The styles were built with **CSS3**, following best practices for maintainability and responsiveness:

- **Flexbox & Grid** → Used for modern, efficient layouts.
- **Media Queries** → Ensured adaptability to different screen sizes.
- **Normalize.css & Reset.css** → Improved cross-browser consistency.
- **Smooth Animations** → Subtle CSS transitions for better UX (if applicable).
